# Week 6 Project Feedback by PM/TA

**Dedicated PM/TA**: Jiahao Yu

## How to Read This Feedback
> [!NOTE]
> **Purpose.** This feedback focuses on your team's progress and collaboration. It is meant as guidance, not judgement.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scope.** For the BVA and TDD items, the PM/TA evaluates only the `main` branch. Ongoing work in feature branches will be evaluated after it is merged. If you'd like early feedback on work in progress, please reach out to your PM/TA directly.

> [!TIP]
> **Mistakes are expected :).** As the instructor mentioned in class, early mistakes are part of the learning process. As long as your team addresses the issues after you get the feedback, your grade will not suffer from them.

## Checklist
Status:
- ✅: All done/Good job!

| 5 | Overall development progress (recall the recommended order is: Game Setup Phase -> One turn of the game -> Multiple turns -> One win condition -> Other win conditions (if applicable) |     ✅     | Strong progress on `main`. This week the team merged Checkstyle/SpotBugs setup, the `Move` class, `Board.movePiece(...)`, and `Game.makeMove(...)`, with corresponding tests. That shows clear forward motion from setup/core game logic into turn execution and multiple-turn behavior. | Canvas assignment Project: Week 4 and 5 Guidance |

## Additional Comments
This is another solid week of visible progress on `main`. One thing I especially like here is that the team is not leaving major implementation work stranded in long-running private branches. The main branch now shows an understandable sequence from foundation data, to core game logic, to move execution and multiple-turn behavior.

One thing to keep improving is the visibility of review discussion. This week the implementation work itself is strong, but the written review discussion is lighter again. Please keep leaving short but concrete review comments about what was checked and why a PR is ready.
